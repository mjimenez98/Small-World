/*
 * A moderate player knows when to place the race in decline, which likely ends its hold on the
 * board, but paves the way for his/her control of another race to renew his/her conquests.
 * (e.g. unless the player's first pick is Ghouls, whose race ability allows him/her to control them as if
 * they were active even though theyâ€™re in decline and should go in decline on the second turn,
 * he/she would want to spend two or three turns with him/her first race)
